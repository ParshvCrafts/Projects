To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.
